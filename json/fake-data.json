I added location visits to locations 2521046 and 2258838. Both of these have a policy but the policy info does not show on the report. Policy information does show for inspections. So, something seems to be off. I think this may be outside the scope of this ticket though. [~lhinze]?\r\n\r\n+{color:#0066cc}Levi Hinze{color}+ added a comment\r\n\r\n[~slowe] [~efarris] So I did a little digging, and this report is the generic Location Time Entry report, which uses the stored procedure TimeExpense.Reports_LocationTimeEntry. The procedure grabs the policies for location visits correctly and places it into a temp table, but in the select statement out of the temp table uses a *STUFF* function to concatinate the policy information into a comma delimited string. The select statement for the *STUFF* function joins on intActivityReportID, which filters out the location visit policy information. See below:\r\n{code:java}\r\nSTUFF(\r\n        (SELECT ', ' + strPolicyNumber\r\n            FROM #LocationTimeEntry t1\r\n            WHERE t1.intActivityReportID = t2.intActivityReportID\r\n            FOR XML PATH(''), TYPE)\r\n                .value('.','varchar(max)'),1,1,''\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n \r\n\r\n*Request* - XLI does NOT want to remove their access to the Location Time Entry Report.  They want this report to be available and it should pull in the policy information for inspections as well as location visits.\r\n\r\n1 - I believe this report is currently in the Generic Reports folder.  We would like to rename this report through the interface and name it \"XLI-Location Time Entry Report\" and move it out of the generic reports folder to make this a report specific to XLI.\r\n\r\n2 - The logic in the report should pull the XLI policy information for inspections and location visits into the appropriate cells in the report.\r\n\r\n*Initial CFA* - The report will be named XLI-Location Time Entry Report.  Time entered for inspections and location visits will populate into the XLI-Location Time Entry report and the policy name and number will show in the report.\r\n\r\n ","project":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/project/10201","id":"10201","key":"JOSUPPORT","name":"JO Support","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?avatarId=10324","24x24":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=small&avatarId=10324","16x16":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10324","32x32":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10324"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10000","id":"10000","description":"JO LOB projects","name":"JO"}},"fixVersions":[],"resolution":null,"customfield_10005":"0|i0005j:1wxt0k","customfield_10203":null,"customfield_10302":null,"customfield_10204":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10122","value":"3 - Medium","id":"10122"},"customfield_10006":2.0,"customfield_10303":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10403","value":"Other","id":"10403","child":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10411","value":"Praeses (Internal)","id":"10411"}},"customfield_10205":"Steps to replicate - Impersonate Venus Newton \r\nBPV Work Planning \r\nFind any location that is insured by XLI and has a policy attached\r\nEdit the Location \r\nWhat do you want to do?

Some customers want copies of the actual inspection reports. \r\n\r\n!image-2017-04-03-11-43-49-615.png|width=734,height=164!\r\n\r\nRequest - On the View/Edit Policy Page, there is a dropdown of reports to include with letters - currently the options are Location Detail Report and Location Detail Spreadsheet. OneCIS would like to add \"Last Inspection Report\" to this list and have a copy of the inspection report pull into the letter.\r\n\r\nInitial CFA - Please let me know what it would take to implement this change for OneCIS.  I would like to give them a time estimate to see if this is a billable request that they would like to pursue. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nHeather\r\n\r\n ","project":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/project/10201","id":"10201","key":"JOSUPPORT","name":"JO Support","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?avatarId=10324","24x24":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=small&avatarId=10324","16x16":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10324","32x32":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10324"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10000","id":"10000","description":"JO LOB projects","name":"JO"}},"fixVersions":[],"resolution":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/resolution/10000","id":"10000","description":"Work has been completed on this issue.","name":"Done"},"customfield_10005":"0|hzzzt3:01000000n","customfield_10203":null,"customfield_10302":null,"customfield_10006":3.0,"customfield_10204":null,"customfield_10303":null,"customfield_10205":null,"customfield_10304":null,"customfield_10206":null,"customfield_10207":null,"customfield_10208":null,"customfield_10209":null,"resolutiondate":"2017-04-12T14:10:11.000-0500","workratio":-1,"summary":"TIME ESTIMATE ONLY - Add Inspection Report as an option in the \"Report to Include with Letters\" dropdown","lastViewed":null,"watches":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/issue/JOSUPPORT-740/watchers","watchCount":5,"isWatching":false},"creator":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/user?username=hcrask","name":"hcrask","key":"hcrask","emailAddress":"heather.crask@praeses.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=48","24x24":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=24","16x16":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=16","32x32":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=32"},"displayName":"Heather Crask","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"created":"2017-04-03T11:47:05.000-0500","reporter":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/user?username=hcrask","name":"hcrask","key":"hcrask","emailAddress":"heather.crask@praeses.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=48","24x24":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=24","16x16":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=16","32x32":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=32"},"displayName":"Heather Crask","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_10000":["com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint@2ac7c3a1[id=95,rapidViewId=3,state=CLOSED,name=JO LOCSQUAD 03/30-04/12,startDate=2017-03-29T15:55:05.248-05:00,endDate=2017-04-12T15:55:00.000-05:00,completeDate=2017-04-12T14:29:04.419-05:00,sequence=95]"],"priority":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://jira.praeses.com/images/icons/priorities/medium.svg","name":"Medium","id":"3"},"customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10100":null,"customfield_10200":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10103","value":"Support Request","id":"10103"},"customfield_10101":null,"customfield_10201":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10108","value":"Location","id":"10108"},"customfield_10300":null,"labels":["cr.sean","heather","jo","onecis","timeestimateonly","uat.heather"],"customfield_10202":null,"customfield_10301":null,"environment":null,"versions":[],"duedate":null,"issuelinks":[],"votes":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/issue/JOSUPPORT-740/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"assignee":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/user?username=James.Loftus","name":"James.Loftus","key":"james.loftus","emailAddress":"James.Loftus@Praeses.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/useravatar?ownerId=james.loftus&avatarId=10606","24x24":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=james.loftus&avatarId=10606","16x16":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=james.loftus&avatarId=10606","32x32":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=james.loftus&avatarId=10606"},"displayName":"James Loftus","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"updated":"2017-04-18T12:02:08.000-0500","status":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

I added location visits to locations 2521046 and 2258838. Both of these have a policy but the policy info does not show on the report. Policy information does show for inspections. So, something seems to be off. I think this may be outside the scope of this ticket though. [~lhinze]?\r\n\r\n+{color:#0066cc}Levi Hinze{color}+ added a comment\r\n\r\n[~slowe] [~efarris] So I did a little digging, and this report is the generic Location Time Entry report, which uses the stored procedure TimeExpense.Reports_LocationTimeEntry. The procedure grabs the policies for location visits correctly and places it into a temp table, but in the select statement out of the temp table uses a *STUFF* function to concatinate the policy information into a comma delimited string. The select statement for the *STUFF* function joins on intActivityReportID, which filters out the location visit policy information. See below:\r\n{code:java}\r\nSTUFF(\r\n        (SELECT ', ' + strPolicyNumber\r\n            FROM #LocationTimeEntry t1\r\n            WHERE t1.intActivityReportID = t2.intActivityReportID\r\n            FOR XML PATH(''), TYPE)\r\n                .value('.','varchar(max)'),1,1,''\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n \r\n\r\n*Request* - XLI does NOT want to remove their access to the Location Time Entry Report.  They want this report to be available and it should pull in the policy information for inspections as well as location visits.\r\n\r\n1 - I believe this report is currently in the Generic Reports folder.  We would like to rename this report through the interface and name it \"XLI-Location Time Entry Report\" and move it out of the generic reports folder to make this a report specific to XLI.\r\n\r\n2 - The logic in the report should pull the XLI policy information for inspections and location visits into the appropriate cells in the report.\r\n\r\n*Initial CFA* - The report will be named XLI-Location Time Entry Report.  Time entered for inspections and location visits will populate into the XLI-Location Time Entry report and the policy name and number will show in the report.\r\n\r\n ","project":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/project/10201","id":"10201","key":"JOSUPPORT","name":"JO Support","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?avatarId=10324","24x24":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=small&avatarId=10324","16x16":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10324","32x32":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10324"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10000","id":"10000","description":"JO LOB projects","name":"JO"}},"fixVersions":[],"resolution":null,"customfield_10005":"0|i0005j:1wxt0k","customfield_10203":null,"customfield_10302":null,"customfield_10204":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10122","value":"3 - Medium","id":"10122"},"customfield_10006":2.0,"customfield_10303":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10403","value":"Other","id":"10403","child":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10411","value":"Praeses (Internal)","id":"10411"}},"customfield_10205":"Steps to replicate - Impersonate Venus Newton \r\nBPV Work Planning \r\nFind any location that is insured by XLI and has a policy attached\r\nEdit the Location \r\nWhat do you want to do?

Data Entry Clerks in the Administrative Group should be able to select multiple inspectors when creating a new BPV or Elevator Appointment.  That appointment will appear under each of the inspectors daily schedule and the appointments will pull into the Appointment Detail Reports.

I have tried numerous times on different locations. {color}\r\n\r\nI updated another inspection using Mobile JO, 2 days after the inspection was done, as before could not edit the inspection date in Mobile JO.\r\n\r\n*Request* - Users should be able to make these edits to the inspections in Mobile JO before they upload the locations/objects/inspections.  Right now he has to flag the objects, upload to core JO, then to go My Offline Work and make the edits to each object before submitting the inspection. \r\n\r\n*Initial CFA* - Mobile JO users should be able to edit the inspection fields, dates, object data and inspection data before uploading to Core JO. The edits that are made will be saved and that correct info will be uploaded.\r\n\r\n*Steps to replicate*: (I did these steps on JORC. Praeses.com and https://jorc.praeses.com/Mobile/Home.mvc\r\n\r\nImpersonate Michael Robillard (Chubb)\r\n\r\nGo to Admin and change his password -\r\n\r\nOn chrome (Mobile JO) sign in\r\n\r\nSearch and Download\r\n\r\nAdvanced - Find any locations - I used New Hampshire because he has a NH commission\r\n\r\nSelect a location with some objects and download\r\n\r\nThen add inspection\r\n\r\nI added an inspection for NH047803 dated 03/28/2017\r\n\r\nEnter all of the other required fields\r\n\r\nSubmit\r\n\r\nThe object will be moved to the \"Processed\" tab\r\n\r\nClick on Processed and open the inspection again - try to change the inspection date (I changed it to 03/26/2017 - submit)\r\n\r\nGo back into the inspection again and you will see that the date doesn't change.  Its still showing 03/28/2017 - the origin ail date that was entered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ","project":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/project/10201","id":"10201","key":"JOSUPPORT","name":"JO Support","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?avatarId=10324","24x24":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=small&avatarId=10324","16x16":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10324","32x32":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10324"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10000","id":"10000","description":"JO LOB projects","name":"JO"}},"fixVersions":[],"resolution":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/resolution/10002","id":"10002","description":"The problem is a duplicate of an existing issue.","name":"Duplicate"},"customfield_10005":"0|i00ckm:","customfield_10203":null,"customfield_10302":null,"customfield_10006":null,"customfield_10204":null,"customfield_10303":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10218","value":"Insurance Companies","id":"10218","child":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10358","value":"Chubb","id":"10358"}},"customfield_10205":null,"customfield_10304":[{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10323","value":"Mobile JO - Mobile JO","id":"10323"}],"customfield_10206":null,"customfield_10207":null,"customfield_10208":null,"customfield_10209":null,"resolutiondate":"2017-04-05T09:55:46.000-0500","workratio":-1,"summary":"Mobile JO - Unable to edit the inspection date in Mobile JO","lastViewed":null,"watches":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/issue/JOSUPPORT-722/watchers","watchCount":1,"isWatching":false},"creator":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/user?username=hcrask","name":"hcrask","key":"hcrask","emailAddress":"heather.crask@praeses.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=48","24x24":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=24","16x16":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=16","32x32":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=32"},"displayName":"Heather Crask","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"created":"2017-03-28T14:12:16.000-0500","reporter":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/user?username=hcrask","name":"hcrask","key":"hcrask","emailAddress":"heather.crask@praeses.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=48","24x24":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=24","16x16":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=16","32x32":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=32"},"displayName":"Heather Crask","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_10000":null,"priority":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/priority/4","iconUrl":"https://jira.praeses.com/images/icons/priorities/low.svg","name":"Low","id":"4"},"customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10100":null,"customfield_10200":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10103","value":"Support Request","id":"10103"},"customfield_10101":null,"customfield_10201":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10106","value":"Inspection","id":"10106"},"customfield_10300":null,"labels":["chubb","heather","mobilejo","uat.lauren"],"customfield_10202":null,"customfield_10301":null,"environment":null,"versions":[],"duedate":null,"issuelinks":[],"votes":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/issue/JOSUPPORT-722/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"assignee":null,"updated":"2017-04-19T15:37:52.000-0500","status":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

This window should be large and all of the information should be visible\r\n\r\nNow click Review next to any line item - I will use the \"You have 4 Inspection Issues to Review\"\r\n\r\nIt looks like nothing happens; however, you should notice that the scroll bar on the right grows and if you scroll down on the page, the information is there, it just wasn't visible because the page is so small.\r\n\r\n!image-2017-03-20-16-24-41-900.png|width=1314,height=492!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ","project":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/project/10201","id":"10201","key":"JOSUPPORT","name":"JO Support","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?avatarId=10324","24x24":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=small&avatarId=10324","16x16":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10324","32x32":"https://jira.praeses.com/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10324"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10000","id":"10000","description":"JO LOB projects","name":"JO"}},"fixVersions":[],"resolution":null,"customfield_10005":"0|i001cn:00wpr","customfield_10203":null,"customfield_10302":null,"customfield_10006":null,"customfield_10204":null,"customfield_10303":null,"customfield_10205":null,"customfield_10304":null,"customfield_10206":null,"customfield_10207":null,"customfield_10208":null,"customfield_10209":null,"resolutiondate":null,"workratio":-1,"summary":"Jurisdictional Import Admin Review page isnt opening properly","lastViewed":"2017-03-29T11:58:42.697-0500","watches":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/issue/JOSUPPORT-701/watchers","watchCount":3,"isWatching":false},"creator":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/user?username=hcrask","name":"hcrask","key":"hcrask","emailAddress":"heather.crask@praeses.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=48","24x24":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=24","16x16":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=16","32x32":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=32"},"displayName":"Heather Crask","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"created":"2017-03-20T16:25:56.000-0500","reporter":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/user?username=hcrask","name":"hcrask","key":"hcrask","emailAddress":"heather.crask@praeses.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=48","24x24":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=24","16x16":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=16","32x32":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ab836ca86b2e0df3cc75a282eefec30?d=mm&s=32"},"displayName":"Heather Crask","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_10000":null,"priority":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/priority/2","iconUrl":"https://jira.praeses.com/images/icons/priorities/high.svg","name":"High","id":"2"},"customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10100":null,"customfield_10200":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10103","value":"Support Request","id":"10103"},"customfield_10101":null,"customfield_10201":null,"customfield_10300":null,"labels":["heather","mo","priority.Juris1","sc","uat.lauren"],"customfield_10202":null,"customfield_10301":null,"environment":null,"versions":[],"duedate":null,"issuelinks":[],"votes":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/issue/JOSUPPORT-701/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"assignee":null,"updated":"2017-03-29T12:55:10.000-0500","status":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/status/10102","description":"","iconUrl":"https://jira.praeses.com/images/icons/statuses/generic.png","name":"In Dev","id":"10102","statusCategory":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/statuscategory/4","id":4,"key":"indeterminate","colorName":"yellow","name":"In Progress"}}}},{"expand":"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields","id":"12612","self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/issue/12612","key":"JOSUPPORT-696","fields":{"issuetype":{"self":"https://jira.praeses.com/rest/api/2/issuetype/10001","id":"10001","description":"gh.issue.story.desc","iconUrl":"https://jira.praeses.com/images/icons/issuetypes/story.svg","name":"Story","subtask":false},"components":[],"description":"Account Manager -

However, if the location doesn't have a Primary Contact name, just a phone number, we need something to pull into the report.  So as a test, I added ‘Manager’ to the first name line.  But the system isn’t pulling that in.  When I typed \"Manager\" in both the first AND last name lines, it pulls into the report – see attached. \r\n\r\n!image-2017-02-15-15-11-09-113.png|width=498,height=172!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe report pulls Primary Contact name (which is correct) -
